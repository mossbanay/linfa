`linfa` aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit to build Machine Learning applications with Rust.

Kin in spirit to Python's `scikit-learn`, it focuses on common preprocessing tasks and classical ML algorithms for your everyday ML tasks.

## Current state

Where does `linfa` stand right now? [Are we learning yet?](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/)

`linfa` currently provides sub-packages with the following algorithms: 


| Name | Purpose | Status | Category |  Notes | 
| :--- | :--- | :---| :--- | :---| 
| [clustering](linfa-clustering/) | Data clustering | Tested / Benchmarked  | Unsupervised learning | Clustering of unlabeled data; contains K-Means, Gaussian-Mixture-Model and DBSCAN  | 
| [kernel](linfa-kernel/) | Kernel methods for data transformation  | Tested  | Pre-processing | Maps feature vector into higher-dimensional space| 
| [linear](linfa-linear/) | Linear regression | Tested  | Partial fit | Contains Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Generalized Linear Models (GLM) | 
| [logistic](linfa-logistic/) | Logistic regression | Tested  | Partial fit | Builds two-class logistic regression models
| [reduction](linfa-reduction/) | Dimensionality reduction | Tested  | Pre-processing | Diffusion mapping and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) |
| [trees](linfa-trees/) | Decision trees | Experimental  | Supervised learning | Linear decision trees
| [svm](linfa-svm/) | Support Vector Machines | Tested  | Supervised learning | Classification or regression analysis of labeled datasets | 
| [hierarchical](linfa-hierarchical/) | Agglomerative hierarchical clustering | Tested | Unsupervised learning | Cluster and build hierarchy of clusters |

We believe that only a significant community effort can nurture, build, and sustain a machine learning ecosystem in Rust - there is no other way forward.

If this strikes a chord with you, please take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa/issues/7) and get involved!

## BLAS/Lapack backend

At the moment you can choose between the following BLAS/LAPACK backends: `openblas`, `netblas` or `intel-mkl`

|Backend  | Linux | Windows | macOS |
|:--------|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|
|OpenBLAS |✔️      |-        |-      |
|Netlib   |✔️      |-        |-      |
|Intel MKL|✔️      |✔️        |✔️      |

For example if you want to use the system IntelMKL library for the PCA example, then pass the corresponding feature:
```
cd linfa-reduction && cargo run --release --example pca --features linfa/intel-mkl-system
```
This selects the `intel-mkl` system library as BLAS/LAPACK backend. On the other hand if you want to compile the library and link it with the generated artifacts, pass `intel-mkl-static`.
